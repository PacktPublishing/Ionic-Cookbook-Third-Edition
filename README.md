# Ionic Cookbook -Third Edition
This is the code repository for [Ionic Cookbook -Third Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/ionic-cookbook-third-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788623230), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Mobile application development has been a hot topic for quite a while now. There are multiple platforms and devices with different screen sizes and form factors out there to accommodate. It makes mobile app development very difficult. Luckily, Ionic is one such tool that helps us mitigate this very problem by allowing us to write code once for all platforms and devices.

In this book, readers will learn how to create mobile applications using Ionic. We will start with very basic things, such as setting up the development environment, using Navigation in apps, working with backend via REST API, Animations, Authenticating Users, Receiving push notifications, localizing an app, generating documentation, and publishing the app, to name a few. Readers will also learn things about Angular and Ionic CLI. I hope that this book will help novice developers as well as advanced developers, because the content is a mixture of easy and advance ionic stuff.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
<ion-tabs> 
  <ion-tab [root]="tab1Root" tabTitle="One" 
   tabIcon="water"></ion-tab>  <ion-tab [root]="tab2Root" 
   tabTitle="Two" 
   tabIcon="leaf"></ion-tab>  <ion-tab [root]="tab3Root" 
   tabTitle="Three" 
   tabIcon="flame"></ion-tab> 
</ion-tabs> 
```

In the book, I assume that you have some knowledge of Angular. Most of the time the problem that you will face will be regarding Angular instead of Ionic. https://angular.io is your best friend in that case.
If you want to brush up your information about Angular, I would suggest this book by Victor Savkin and Jeff Cross (former Angular team members) https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/essential-angular.
Even though you can run most of examples without installing platform SDKs for Android or iOS. I suggest you to do this in the very beginning, in order to test the applications on actual devices. Take a look at these guides:
Android: https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/android/index.html#requirements-and-support 
iOS: https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/ios/index.html
